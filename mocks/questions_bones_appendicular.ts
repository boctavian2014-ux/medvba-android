    question: 'Which statement about the cuneiform bones is MOST accurate?',
    options: [
      'There are two cuneiform bones that articulate only with the talus',
      'There are three cuneiform bones (medial, intermediate, lateral) located between the navicular and the bases of the first three metatarsals',
      'The cuneiform bones lie between the calcaneus and cuboid',
      'All cuneiform bones form the lateral longitudinal arch exclusively',
      'The cuneiform bones articulate only with each other'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Three wedge-shaped cuneiform bones (medial, intermediate, lateral) lie between the navicular posteriorly and the bases of the first, second and third metatarsals anteriorly, contributing to medial and transverse arches.[web:525][web:539][web:542]'

    question: 'Which articulations define the subtalar (talocalcaneal) joint and its primary function?',
    options: [
      'Between talus and tibia; allows dorsiflexion and plantarflexion',
      'Between calcaneus and cuboid; allows toe flexion',
      'Between talus and calcaneus at multiple facets; permits inversion and eversion of the hindfoot',
      'Between navicular and cuneiforms; allows abduction of toes',
      'Between talus and metatarsals; transmits body weight directly to toes'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      'The subtalar joint is formed by articulations between talus and calcaneus at anterior, middle and posterior facets and mainly allows inversion and eversion movements of the hindfoot.[web:525][web:535][web:540]'

    question: 'Functionally, how do the navicular and cuboid differ in distributing forces through the foot?',
    options: [
      'Navicular transmits forces to lateral metatarsals; cuboid to medial metatarsals',
      'Navicular primarily transmits forces from talus to medial three metatarsals via cuneiforms; cuboid transmits forces from calcaneus to the 4th and 5th metatarsals',
      'Both bones transmit forces only to the talus',
      'Both bones only support the transverse arch',
      'Navicular and cuboid have no role in force transmission'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'The navicular relays load from the talus to the cuneiforms and then to the first three metatarsals, while the cuboid relays load from the calcaneus to the 4th and 5th metatarsals.[web:525][web:532][web:534]'
